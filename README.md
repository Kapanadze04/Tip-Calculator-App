# Tip Calculator App

## Summary

- "Frontendmentor.io" challenge. This application helps for example a group of people working in a restaurant. If, for example, a customer paid more than he was entitled to at will. This overpayment will be distributed to the specific staff working in the restaurant. And if each one meets how many, this application will count it.

## Principle of operation of the application

- We write the total amount in the "Bill column".
- We choose a specific percentage or write the one we want in the "Custom" column.
- In the "Number of people" column, write the number of people to whom the tip should be distributed.
- After that, the results will be displayed in the right green column of the application. And if we want to completely clear the results, we will use the RESET button.
